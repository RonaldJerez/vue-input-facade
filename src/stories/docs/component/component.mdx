### Basic usage

<Canvas of={componentStories.BasicUsage} sourceState="shown" />

### Optional character

Use a question mark (?) to indicate that a character is optional. Similar to regular expression this means 0 or 1.

<Canvas of={componentStories.OptionalCharacter} sourceState="shown" />

### Repeating character

Use an asterisk (*) as a suffix to set a masking character as repeating, similar to regular expression. Note that this means that 0 or more of said character will match. If you need to match  1 or more than you must specify it.

<Canvas of={componentStories.RepeatingCharacter} sourceState="shown" />

### Alternation (Pipe)

Use a pipe symbol to indicate altarnative **static** values that can be used in the mask. This is case insensitive and can match letters irregarless of accents. For field Ã¥ = A. Android webview and Opera dont fully support that type of matching.
> *Note that because this only works with static values there is no need to escape characters that are also used as tokens.*

### Dynamic Masks

Accepts an array of masking pattern and dynamically chooses the appropriate one based on the number of characters in the field.

<Canvas of={componentStories.DynamicMasks} sourceState="shown" />

### Custom Tokens

You can override the tokens on a per field basis. Just pass in your own token definition to the field.
This can also be used to add internatilization support.

<Canvas of={componentStories.CustomTokens} sourceState="shown" />

### Post masking input formatter

Returning a string in the format function will re-run that value through the masker routine, Ensuring that the end result still confirms to the mask.

Returning a boolean `true` will leave the masked or unmasked value as is, the value is passed by reference so if you modify them here, that will be their final value. However if a `false` is returned, the user's input will be ignored and the value will remain as it was prior.
